# scPancreasAtlas

This repository contains .loom file supplemental to the article "The Gene Regulatory Landscape of the Human Adult Pancreas Reveals Critical Regulators of Cell Identity".

As a resource to community we provide .loom files that contain UMAP plots, cluster annotations, expression and gene regulatory data from datasets analyzed in the manuscript.

.loom files can be downloaded here: scPancreasAtlas.loom [https://filesender.belnet.be/?s=download&token=8d087b4d-3909-4fc4-8c11-a92fb9989bec] and browsed interactively using [SCope platform](https://scope.aertslab.org). SCope was developed and is maintained by [Aerts lab.](https://www.aertslab.org/)

In order to browse the datasets, upload loom files by clicking on "Upload dataset" in the menu on the left-side of SCope website. Uploading may take a few minutes. Successful upload will activate a private, temporary session for the user. Each session expires after 5 days, but can be renewed by re-uploading the loom file. 
Standalone SCope apps for macOS and Linux can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/aertslab/SCope/releases).
